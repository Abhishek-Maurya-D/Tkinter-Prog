# 🪟 Tkinter-Prog

A collection of **Python GUI programs** built using **Tkinter** — Python’s standard graphical user interface toolkit included in most Python installations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This repository is designed as a hands-on playground for learning how to create desktop applications with buttons, input fields, windows, layouts, events, and more.

## 🧠 What is Tkinter?

Tkinter is a Python package that provides access to the Tk GUI toolkit. It lets you build simple to moderately complex desktop applications without needing any external libraries. Tkinter comes bundled with Python, so you usually don’t need to install anything extra to start creating GUI apps. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

---

## 📌 Highlights

This repo includes:

✔ GUI programs demonstrating Tkinter Widgets (Buttons, Labels, Entries, etc)  
✔ Event-driven code (clicks, input handling)  
✔ Window layout examples  
✔ Projects that illustrate basic GUI functionality

Each script is self-contained and easy to run.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- 🐍 **Python 3.x** installed (Tkinter is included by default)  
- A terminal or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)  

*(You can test Tkinter is available by running `python -m tkinter` — a simple window should pop up.)* :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 📂 How To Run the Code

1. **Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-Maurya-D/Tkinter-Prog.git
````

2. **Navigate into the directory**

```bash
cd Tkinter-Prog
```

3. **Run a Python Tkinter script**

```bash
python script_name.py
```

For example, if you have a script called `calculator.py`, you would run:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

---

## 🧪 Example

Here’s what running a simple Tkinter script might look like:

```bash
$ python hello_gui.py
```

This should open a desktop window with UI elements defined in the script.

## 🎯 Project Ideas

You could extend this repo with:

* 📍 A counter app with buttons
* 🗒 A basic text editor
* 🪄 A todo list with add/remove features
* 🧮 A simple calculator GUI
* 🛠 A form with validation and submit button

Building these will help deepen your understanding of GUI design in Python.

## 🚀 Keep Learning

Tkinter makes desktop applications accessible and fun for beginners. It’s a great next step after mastering Python basics. There are many tutorials and examples online to explore deeper GUI concepts like event loops, geometry managers, and widget styling. ([Real Python][2])

Happy GUI coding! 🎉
